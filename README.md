# NLP Disaster Tweets Kaggle Challenge
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used to create various neural networks trained to classify whether or not tweets are disaster-related. The data came from the [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/) on Kaggle. This served as the assignment for week 4 in DTSA 5511: Introduction to Deep Learning at the University of Colorado Boulder.
